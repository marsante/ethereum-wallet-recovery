1. `python generating.py -h` #wordlist generator
    - -h                # help
    - -s any,words      # comma separated words
    - -v file           # words from file separated by comma
    - -a                # generate from ascii table
    - -min number       # specify minimal generated word length
    - -max number       # specify maximal generated word length
    
2. `python py3ethrecover.py`  #eth wallet password tester
    - -h                # help
    - -p file           # keystore ethereum wallet file
    - -z file           # starting words separated by line
    - -k file           # ending words separated by line
    - -v N              # number of threads of jobs
    - -w file           # wordlist file
    - -b arg            # bruteforce type
        - ASCII         # whole ascii table
        - whatever char by char eg. 1234567890 or @#!$%^&*(
    - -d N              # bruteforce character leght

### Examples generating.py:
  #### makes all possible combinations of words separated by comma. 
  `python generating.py -s "first,second,third"`      
  
  #### makes all possible combinations of words inside file input.txt separated by comma.
  `python generating.py -v input.txt`                
  
  #### makes all possible combinations of numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 with minimal length 8. less length size is skipped.
  `python generating.py -min 8 -s "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0"`

  #### makes all possible combinations of numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 with maximal length 4, more length size is skipped.
  `python generating.py -max 4 -s "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0"`

  - generated wordlist will be in same directory with name wordlist_01.txt. 
  - When wordlist reach maximum file size 50MB then new file will be created with next name wordlist_02.txt

### Examples py3ethrecover.py:
  #### bruteforce numbers from 0 to 9 with size of 2

  #### bruteforce @#! with size of 3
  `python py3ethrecover.py -p UTC--2017-07-12T00-06-42.772050600Z--f5751c906091b98be2a6be5ce42c573d704aedab -b @#! -d 3`
  
  #### bruteforce whole ASCII table with size of 4

  #### bruteforce numbers from 0 to 9 with size of 2 and starting words from file start.txt separated by lines
  `python py3ethrecover.py -p UTC--2017-07-12T00-06-42.772050600Z--f5751c906091b98be2a6be5ce42c573d704aedab -b 1234567890 -d 2 -z start.txt`
  
  #### bruteforce numbers from 0 to 9 with size of 4 and ending words from file end.txt separated by lines
  `python py3ethrecover.py -p UTC--2017-07-12T00-06-42.772050600Z--f5751c906091b98be2a6be5ce42c573d704aedab -b 1234567890 -d 2 -k end.txt`
  
  #### use words from wordlist generated by generating.py
  `python py3ethrecover.py -p UTC--2017-07-12T00-06-42.772050600Z--f5751c906091b98be2a6be5ce42c573d704aedab -w wordlist_01.txt`
